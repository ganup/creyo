<span><strong>Latest release notes: </strong>This release provides an improved fix to an issue that appeared some days ago. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Some users face large delays opening the Main page of the plugin in Dashboard.</span><span> This is caused by problems accessing Iptanus Secure Services server. Efforts are being made to resolve the problem and issue a permanent solution. In the meantime, <strong>this release contains a temporary fix for users having this problem</strong>. The maximum delay is adjusted to 10 seconds. Furthermore, an environment variable has been added, <strong>Disable Version Check</strong>, that enables/disables version check of the plugin. When this variable is set to 'true' then no version check will be performed, however there will be no delays when opening Main page of the plugin in Dashboard. It is set to 'false' by default.</span><br /><br /><span>
